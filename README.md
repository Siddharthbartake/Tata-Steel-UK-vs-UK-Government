# Tata-Steel-UK-vs-UK-Government
Conducted in-depth analysis of the UK government's climate change policies and their impact on Tata Steelâ€™s UK operations. Delivered actionable insights and strategic recommendations to mitigate risks and align business practices with regulatory requirements.

**#Summary**
The inception of the United Kingdom's emission impositions on Tata Steel seems to lie with
the Paris Climate Change Act of 2008, where multiple countries have signed and agreed to
reduce carbon emissions. The United Kingdom has established a legally
binding agenda to reduce carbon emissions and render the country with zero carbon
emissions by 2050. Such a bold move by the UK has impacted multiple industries. And Tata
Steel is one such organization.
In response to this stance by the UK, Tata Steel has focused its efforts on all fronts of
innovation to reduce carbon emissions. They have shown that they want to align themself
with the direction of the UK government. They have asked the UK government for their
support in terms of direct compensation for the shift to green, net zero steel production.
Tata has done exceptionally well with regard to the effort of producing green steel through
lower carbon emissions. They have set up global R&D centers and created and nurtured
partnerships with multiple organizations in this regard. They have ventured into multiple
technologies that will reduce carbon emissions at their steel production plant in Talbot. In
terms of financials, Tata is doing well in the United Kingdom and is making a profit.
Based on the reduction in employment numbers in the UK Steel Industry it is clearly evident
that the country is shifting its core from metals production. On the other hand, the UK has
multiple other industry sectors that depend on steel for manufacturing products. Another facet
of this data is related to the concentration of steel production in China and India. This may
lead to a monopoly of steel. This in its fact is detrimental to the UK. Based on the above
factors the UK is most likely to support efforts made by Tata Steel to reduce carbon
emissions and would settle with a staggered fix as long as there is a plan of progress in the
future.
Another aspect to consider is related to the carbon credits system introduced by the UK
Government in collaboration with other countries. Companies are allocated carbon credits
based on industry. Additionally, these companies can trade carbon credits based on need. It is
also seen that Tata Steel has been allocated the highest number of carbon credits in the UK.
The way ahead for Tata Steel is to continue operations in the country, this decision is backed
by excellent profits in the UK market. Additionally, the UK Government relies heavily on
steel production from Tata Steel to keep the international trade balances stable and at the
same time avoid reliability on China. The UK government extended support to Tata with a
huge deposit of free carbon credits.
Tata Steel can navigate this by initially utilizing the free carbon credits in the United
Kingdom. Additionally, they can purchase additional carbon credits if the need arises. Next,
they could accelerate their programs to generate green carbon steel. Once these green
technologies are implemented, they will be able to promote green carbon products rolled out
by Tata in other markets. And use the surplus carbon emissions to support the industry.
This approach will have business impacts in the short term as well as in the long term. The
constant push for innovation will give them a competitive advantage in terms of green steel
production. However, this means they will need to first invest heavily in research and
innovation.
